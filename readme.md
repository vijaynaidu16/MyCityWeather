### 3. Set Up Environment Variable

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key.

#### For **Vite**:

VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### For **Create React App (CRA)**:

```env

npm run dev
```

For CRA:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open:

* [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (Vite)

## 🌐 API Reference – OpenWeatherMap
